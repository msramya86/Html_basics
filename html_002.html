            <p align="justify">We believe that traveling around the world shouldn’t be hard: it’s actually something everyone should be able to do at least once in their lives. Whether you choose to spend a few years or just a couple months traveling this beautiful planet, it’s important to see what’s out there. It’s up to you to make the dream come true and take the first step. Here we’ve rounded up types of travel. It’s never too late to tick another off the list, and remember, you can’t knock it until you try it.</p>
            <p align="justify">Since then, I’ve traveled to over 100 countries and territories, traveled hundreds of thousands of miles, slept in over a thousand hostels, tried weird food (including fried maggots), made lifelong friends, learned multiple languages, and, most importantly, made it my mission now to help travelers like YOURSELF to realize YOUR travel dreams the same way those five backpackers helped me realize mine.</p>
            <p align="justify">This website has been featured on major media sites time and time again because it’s the best budget advice out there. Our system works. We’re going to make you a smarter traveler.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A business trip is a trip undertaken for work or business purposes, as opposed to other types of travel, such as for leisure purposes or regularly commuting between one’s home and workplace.
                <li>Going on family vacations or with friends of course has a different planning to do than when it’s about a business trip.</li>
                <li>The needs while being on a business trip are always different.</li>    
                <li>You need to carry professional and sophisticated stuff to be perfect for your business meetings or programs such as Cufflink Case, Tie Case, Watch Case and other Travel accessories</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 align="center">2.Solo Travel</h2>
            <img src="https://m.economictimes.com/thumb/msid-68187430,width-1200,height-900,resizemode-4,imgsize-1039384/solotravel.jpg" alt="Travel image" width="590" height ="366" > 
            <ul>
                <li>Solo travel means you’re going somewhere else alone, where you will spend a significant chunk of time alone once you get there.
                <li>Going on family vacations or with friends of course has a different planning to do than when it’s about a business trip.</li>
                <li>Traveling alone is not uncommon and most solo travelers are able to meet other travelers at hostels, bars, organized tours or any place where travelers tend to hang out or congregate. </li>    
            </ul>  
            <h2 align="center">3.Travel With Friends</h2>
            <img src="https://www.rd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/friends-traveling-exploring-scaled.jpg" alt="Travel image" width="590" height ="366" >
            <ul>
                <li>Traveling alone is a unique experience and can be a very rewarding way of traveling but
                     When we travel with our friends, those memories become even more priceless in our bank of golden experiences. </li>
                <li>Exploring a different country, conquering fears together and discovering new perspectives ultimately progresses our relationships to levels never imagined possible.</li>
                <li>Embarking on a journey with your friends is an unpredictable voyage that every person should experience at least once in his or her life.</li>    
                <li>You need to carry professional and sophisticated stuff to be perfect for your business meetings or programs such as Cufflink Case, Tie Case, Watch Case and other Travel accessories</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 align="center">4.Family Travel</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Just because you’ve settled down and have kids doesn’t mean your adventuring days are through. </li>
                <li>Traveling with a family is a completely different beast than traveling solo or as a couple.</li>    
                <li>Travelling as a family is always fun and lovable vacation at any age.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 align="center">5.Travel With Group</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Traveling with a group is another must-do.</li>
                <li>Traveling in a group means you are sharing the experience with others who have a similar mindset, creating great conversations and bonding experiences.</li>
                <li>At the same time, you’re widening your circle of companions who share similar interests for free-time exploration.</li>    
                <li>I enjoy travelling with different groups which always adds up new knowledge and more experience.</li>
            </ul>  
            <h2 align="center">6.Luxury Travel</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Luxury travel is to undertake a new experience and immerse in a new destination whilst indulging in the very best levels of personal and attentive service, lavish and sumptuous accommodation, exquisite and unrivaled levels of gastronomy and informative and educational guides.</li>
                <li>It is travel without stress, pressure of time or daily routine, where your every need is pre-empted and your every expectation is met and exceeded.</li>
                <li>This kind of luxury travel is needed once in a while to pamper yourself.</li>    
                <li>While I enjoy this kind of travel there should be a checkpoint to save your wallet.</li>
            </ul>
